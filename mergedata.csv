Tomorrow is the first day of sophomore year, I’m pretty excited. Mostly because I’ll finally get to see my best friend Alex after about a month. We had hung out a bunch at the beginning of summer but it slowly got to where we didn’t even text. It was probably just something to do with his family.. He doesn’t live in a great environment. His mother doesn’t care for him, when she does it’s not helpful, while his father beats her and him every night when he gets home from the bar.
But that’s not really the case I suppose. He’s my friend, I’m his. I’m there for him when he needs it, I try not to complain much. He’s basically a loser in our school though, that’s why it’s important for me to be there for him. But that changes ya know? It changed.

About





Death befits me is a story where the antagonist is the protagonist. I’ve designed this so that you, the reader, will grow more and more dislike for the main character as the story goes on. There will be scenes and themes that are highly suggestible and inappropriate. One in particular will more than likely stand out than others, but I purposely created it like that for the sole reason to lower the moral of the main character. So don’t look at me oddly, or report anything if you feel a type of way. You have been warned.  With that being said, enjoy the story for what it is and not what it could be.",True Crime,17

Diderot also contributed to literature, notably with Jacques le fataliste et son maître (Jacques the Fatalist and his Master), which was influenced by Laurence Sterne's novel Tristam Shandy in challenging conventions regarding novels and their structure and content,[1] while also examining philosophical ideas about free will.

When a girl shows him the only love he's had in his life, an obsession begins.
 
 “Please, please no.” she whimpered, horror-struck when he came near. He looked at the knife fondly, then at her. “My beautiful Evelyn, you have hurt me. I have punished myself already for hurting you, now it’s time for yours.” She tried to run, but he was faster, he grabbed her tender arm and threw her onto the bed, leaning over her. “No please no!” she begged, tears fell down her face silently as she sobbed. He set the knife down and sat on her; he grabbed her hands roughly and pulled them over her head. He grabbed the knife and set it at her wrists. “Honestly love I don’t want to do this but you misbehaved and I just can’t let you get away with that.” A piercing pain hit her wrists, as the metallic frame became tainted with her crimson blossoms.

 Opinions from reviews
 An exciting, up-to-date scientific thriller that could well occupy a sure spot in the genre „thriller“. With his book the author sets up a frightening scenario of spying in the world of science. (Amazon) 
 
 
 In the battle for power a human life counts for nothing – an explosive theme well presented (Lovelybooks)
 
 This first novel contains all the classical elements of a thriller. It is concerned just as much with research, quantum computer science and semiconductor technology as with plots, corruption, and murder! (Magazine for Computer Technology c´t 1/15)

The views have been accumulated over more than a decade through a continuous process of contemplation, acceptance, abandonment, re-acceptance and so on and so forth, and the process continues...on my website ankurmutreja.com. This book is, in fact, a consolidation of my views concretized on my blogs over years – which can be accessed from my website – and is divided into four sections: Satire, Reviews, Opinions and Philosophy. 
To be very frank, this is my selfish attempt to influence you towards my worldview, but, trust me, I have a sense of humor; so, there is a strong possibility that some of my writings may entertain you; I would recommend anybody who has laid his hands on this book to at least check out the first section entitled Satire – it is a very small section and a pretty light reading. Then, you may move onto the Reviews section – as a natural transition from ultra-light to light – where I have reviewed Travel Locales, Books, Movies and more. My Opinions follow next. I am an Advocate by profession, so I have written extensively on Law along with other subjects like Rights -- especially Privacy, Liberty, Equality and Non-Arbitrariness -- Economy, International Issues, Politics, etc. At the end of the book, I have presented my personal philosophy divided into six sub-sections: Privacy, Relations, Women, Abstract, Social and Political.",Law,592

I started writing opinions in the year 2008 through my blogs. I admit at times I did go wild with unsubstantiated accusations and surmises, leading to risky speculations and irresponsible opinions. Recently, I published a comprehensive book of my writings entitled ""Writings @ Ankur Mutreja"", and the present book is a short selection of my opinions presented therein with emphasis on responsible writing. 

I am an advocate by profession; therefore, most of my opinions have a tint of law; in the first part, the expression is simple; so, it is for lay persons who won’t mind a little exercise of mind in the legal arena; whereas, in the second part, I have gone whole hog with law, and I admit those without formal legal training may find it convenient to ignore. 

My style of writing is terse and pointed, but at times I have gone overboard like in one particular opinion on Aarushi murder, where emotions and logic intermingled in an expanded narrative. 

Rights, especially privacy and equality, are my area of focus; therefore most of my opinions herein; i.e., the ones discussing Brain Research, NCTC, Sting Operations, LGBTs, Prostitution, SC/ST quotas, and AADHAR/NPR; are focused on these two areas. 

In my selection, I have tried steering clear of politics, but politics is nevertheless all encompassing; however, one opinion on tussle between Delhi Police and AAP is majorily political; another political opinion, but with a strong emphasis on law, is the discussion of Zakia Jaffrey case. 

There were few very big events in the recent past; one amongst them is the Nirbhaya murder, and I have also discussed it, though my take is slightly different: I think the murder has been manipulated by the vested interests. 

I am a resident of an unauthorized colony; therefore, my opinion on Unauthorized Colonies has found place in the present selection; though I admit had the case been different, I wouldn’t have included it; so please bear with my little bias. 

Though I have no expertise in international affairs, I have taken a plunge into it albeit within the ambit of my legal training; the topics discussed are Indo-Pak relationship and Julian Assange.

Finally, in the second part, I have discussed various judgments and laws. I would recommend anybody to read at least my critique of Aarushi Judgement. Other than that I have critiqued Binayak Sen Judgement and Aruna Shaunbaug Judgement. In the second part, I have also critiqued RTI Act and Amendments in IPC post Nirbhaya murder.

Although the adversarial system is contrasted with the inquisitorial system, thelatter in fact also enshrines in lawthe right of theaccusedtoopposethe evidence of the prosecution and introduce evidence to prove innocence; it is thus 'contradictoire' (to use the French term) or adversarial in that sense. It is rather the structure and organisation of the forensic process or investigative method, than the adversarial nature of proceedings, that distinguishes the two systems.I In an adversarial system, the parties, acting independently and in a partisan fashion, are responsible for uncovering and presenting evidence before a passive and neutral trial judge or jury. In an inquisitorial system, the ultimateresponsibility for findingthe truth lieswithanofficialbody that acts with judicial authority, and gathers evidence both for and against the accused.

The first educator to offer a psychology course in the United States,[2] James was one of the leading thinkers of the late nineteenth century and is believed by many to be one of the most influential philosophers the United States has ever produced, while others have labelled him the ""Father of American psychology"".[3][4][5] Along with Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey, he is considered to be one of the major figures associated with the philosophical school known as pragmatism, and is also cited as one of the founders of functional psychology. He also developed the philosophical perspective known as radical empiricism. James' work has influenced intellectuals such as Émile Durkheim, W. E. B. Du Bois, Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Hilary Putnam, and Richard Rorty.[6]



Born into a wealthy family, James was the son of the Swedenborgian theologian Henry James Sr and the brother of both the prominent novelist Henry James, and the diarist Alice James. James wrote widely on many topics, including epistemology, education, metaphysics, psychology, religion, and mysticism. Among his most influential books are The Principles of Psychology, which was a groundbreaking text in the field of psychology, Essays in Radical Empiricism, an important text in philosophy, and The Varieties of Religious Experience, which investigated different forms of religious experience, which also included the then theories on Mind cure.[7]",Psychology,4

Still, the same human consciousness is the most potent trouble. The core dilemma is, modern day problems are so ‘dressed up’; partly by our complex environment and partly by our consciousness that we fail to see the ‘naked’ reality of the nature of problems. We can see them clearly, if we ‘undress’ them. 
Solution of problems is not a big task. If you have a problem, you already know it that solution is somewhere ‘inherent and embedded’ in the problem itself. The milieu around us presents some factors in an ‘arrangement’, which stand in our disadvantage, at a particular stage of our life positioning and we call the outcome of such an arrangement as a ‘problem’.
 Often, solution presents itself as some ‘alternative’ arrangement or placement of the same factors in such a way that they turn advantageous for us, hence qualifying as a ‘solution’.
 In most cases, especially the modern day problems we face, the artistry of arriving at solutions is not in ‘creating’ or generating something externally but in ‘rearranging’ and ‘repositioning’ the already present factors and elements in some alternative ways. That is why, we need little ‘action’ but loads of calm and objective ‘reception’ in analyzing the ‘factors’ that essentially constitute a problem.

One night when she was just 12 years old, Child and her sister snuck out of the family home against their father's wishes to hear Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton speak on women's suffrage.[2] The experience proved to be transformative and Dorr became committed to the idea of voting as a fundamental right even at this early age.[2]



Child studied for two years at the University of Nebraska before moving in 1890 to New York City, where she worked as a journalist. While in New York she met John Pixley Dorr, a conservative businessman from Seattle. The couple were married in 1892 and moved to Seattle to start a family.

Even after her marriage Rheta Dorr continued to work as a journalist, interviewing gold miners returning from Alaska writing articles for New York newspapers as a freelancer.

Haeckel promoted and popularized Charles Darwin's work in Germany and developed the controversial recapitulation theory (""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"") claiming that an individual organism's biological development, or ontogeny, parallels and summarizes its species' evolutionary development, or phylogeny.



The published artwork of Haeckel includes over 100 detailed, multi-colour illustrations of animals and sea creatures (see: Kunstformen der Natur, ""Art Forms of Nature""). As a philosopher, Ernst Haeckel wrote Die Welträtsel (1895–1899, in English, The Riddle of the Universe, 1901), the genesis for the term ""world riddle"" (Welträtsel); and Freedom in Science and Teaching[2] to support teaching evolution.",Architecture,3236

families, but a hundred thousand families, would come to Brazil.



As a matter of fact, this exodus, when it took place, was so small that

it failed to raise a ripple on the social pool of the Western

Hemisphere. But to the self-chosen few who suffered shipwreck and

privation, financial loss from their already depleted store, disaster to

their Utopian dreams, and a great void in their hearts where once had

been love of country, it became a tragedy--the tragedy of existence.



The ardor that led a small band of irreconcilables to gather their

households and their household goods about them and flee from a personal

oppression, as had their ancestors before them, was destined to be short

lived. From the first, fate frowned upon their enterprise. They looked

for calm seas and favorable winds, but they found storms and shipwreck.

Their scanty resources were calculated to meet the needs of only the

crudest life, but upon the threshold of their goal they fell into the

red-tape trammels of a civilization older than their own. Where they

looked for a free country, a wilderness flowing with milk and honey,

which in their ignorance they imagined unpeopled, they found the

squatter had been intrenched since the Jesuit fathers and their

following explored the continent four centuries before. Finally, they

believed themselves to be the vanguard of a horde, but, once in the

breach, they found there was no following host.



Most of those who had the means reversed their flight. Others, with

nothing left but their broken pride, sought aid from the government they

abhorred, and were given a free passage back in returning men-of-war.

But when the reflux had waned and died, there was still a residue of

half a hundred families, most of whom were so destitute that they could

not reach the coast. With them stayed a very few who were held by their

premature investments or by a deeper loyalty or a greater pride. Among

the latter was the head of the divided house of Leighton.

The Reverend Orme Leighton was one of those to whom the war had brought

a double portion of bitterness, for the Leightons of Leighton, Virginia,

had fought not alone against the North, but against the North and the

Leightons of Leighton, Massachusetts.



To the Reverend Orme Leighton, a schism in the church would have meant

nothing unless it came to the point of cracking heads; but a schism in

governmental policy, which placed the right to govern one's self and own",Architecture,2

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is being well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.

Now the Protest opposes two abuses of man in matters of faith: the first is the intrusion of the civil magistrate, and the second the arbitrary authority of [religion]. Instead of these abuses, the Protest sets the power of conscience above the magistrate, and the authority of the word of God above the visible church. In the first place, it rejects the civil power in divine things ... The protesters had moreover affirmed their right to utter freely their convictions of truth.

He wrote some of his books under the pseudonyms Dod Grile and J. Milton Sloluck. Bierce's lucid, unsentimental style has kept him popular when many of his contemporaries have been consigned to oblivion. His dark, sardonic views and vehemence as a critic earned him the nickname, ""Bitter Bierce. "" Such was his reputation that it was said his judgment on any piece of prose or poetry could make or break a writer's career. His short stories are considered among the best of the 19th century, providing a popular following based on his roots. He wrote realistically of the terrible things he had seen in the war in such stories as An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, Killed at Resaca, and Chickamauga. His works include: The Fiend's Delight (1873), Cobwebs from an Empty Skull (1874), Black Beetles in Amber (1892), Fantastic Fables (1899), Shapes of Clay (1903), A Son of the Gods, and A Horseman in the Sky (1907), Write It Right (1909) and A Cynic Looks at Life (1912).",Language & Literature,2

For the first time, this collection makes further extensive works available with texts in an unknown language including unknown writing and font decryption. 
This is also done in digital form. 
In addition to the extensive works, there is also a smaller work about numbers and basic mathematical calculations.
Due to the forms of the glyphs, the writing is called Cusy (cubic-symmetrical), the language CusyA, just in case, in the future further documents with the same characters may appear, using words in a different language.
The content of the texts has not yet been deciphered, only the rough semantic structure of chapters, headings, paragraphs, verses, lines is known and accordingly transcribed in the publication. 
From the same source as the texts themselves the so far decoded grammar of CusyA is made available, rather a plausible hypothesis to it, whose extent lets assume that there are further works in CusyA, on the basis of which the grammar was decoded, which are not available however at present.
CusyA surrounds many secrets. 
Origin and history are unknown, the script shows little similarity with writings from human history, the grammar is also special, but reflects typical language structures in a strongly formalised, regular form.
The authors of this book were given the texts because they have already dealt with xenolinguistics, quantitative text analysis and statistical cryptology of texts in other books of the series Abstract Literature.
Accordingly, statistical data of a quantitative text analysis are published together with the texts in order to help with the further decoding of the actual contents.
The texts are supplemented with Abstract Art, whereby these graphics take up again the cubic Bézier curves of the glyphs, but without symmetry in order to loosen up the book graphically a little, also in order to offer a contrast to the text works as commentary. 
The graphics are thus also conceived in the sense of alienation effects to keep the critical view of the audience awake and to remain sceptical of one's own hypotheses when decoding the texts.

Some twentieth-century artists and architects, including Le Corbusier and Dalí, have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially in the form of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing (see Applications and observations below). Mathematicians since Euclid have studied the properties of the golden ratio, including its appearance in the dimensions of a regular pentagon and in a golden rectangle, which can be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same aspect ratio.
